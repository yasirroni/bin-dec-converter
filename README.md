# Binary and Decimal Converter
This code is inspired from MATLAB code and can be used to generate matrix of binary. It's useful for genetic algorithm and other usage. The MATLAB code is modification of Efficient onvertors between binary and decimal numbers by Zacharias Voulgaris (2020) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26447-efficient-convertors-between-binary-and-decimal-numbers), MATLAB Central File Exchange.

# Original preface by Zacharias Voulgaris (https://www.mathworks.com)
Convert a binary array to a decimal number
Similar to bin2dec but works with arrays instead of strings and is found to be rather faster

# Modification Notes
1. d2b.m: error handling and array processing
2. b2d.m: speed and array processing
